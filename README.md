# Software-Defined-Routing
Implemented a simplified version of a router in C++, which performs Control Plane and Data Plane functionalities and performs routing updates in a Distance Vector Routing fashion. This system model was built on top of Computer Science Department servers (acting as routers) at the University at Buffalo and hence performed routing for all possible network topologies. System capabilities include, but are not limited to:

1. Distance Vector routing updates between 5 servers acting as routers.
2. Link cost update notification propagation and network convergence.
3. Router failure handling and network convergence.
4. Listening to Controller codes and responding to controller with appropriate responses.

More to add. . .
File transfers between the routers, File Stats Management etc.
